# GANSynth

GANSynth is an algorithm for synthesizing audio with generative adversarial networks.
The details can be found in the [ICLR 2019 Paper](https://openreview.net/forum?id=H1xQVn09FX). It achieves better audio quality than WaveNet baselines on the [NSynth Dataset](https://magenta.tensorflow.org/datasets/nsynth), and synthesizes audio tens of thousands of times faster.
