"""Defines the main RL Tuner class.

RL Tuner is a Deep Q Network (DQN) with augmented reward to create melodies
by using reinforcement learning to fine-tune a trained Note RNN according
to some music theory rewards.

Also implements two alternatives to Q learning: Psi and G learning. The
algorithm can be switched using the 'algorithm' hyperparameter.

For more information, please consult the README.md file in this directory.

    Args:
      output_dir: Where the model will save its compositions (midi files).
      dqn_hparams: A HParams object containing the hyperparameters of
        the DQN algorithm, including minibatch size, exploration probability,
        etc.
      reward_mode: Controls which reward function can be applied. There are
        several, including 'scale', which teaches the model to play a scale,
        and of course 'music_theory_all', which is a music-theory-based reward
        function composed of other functions.
      reward_scaler: Controls the emphasis placed on the music theory rewards.
        This value is the inverse of 'c' in the academic paper.
      exploration_mode: can be 'egreedy' which is an epsilon greedy policy, or
        it can be 'boltzmann', in which the model will sample from its output
        distribution to choose the next action.
      priming_mode: Each time the model begins a new composition, it is primed
        with either a random note ('random_note'), a random MIDI file from the
        training data ('random_midi'), or a particular MIDI file
        ('single_midi').
      stochastic_observations: If False, the note that the model chooses to
        play next (the argmax of its softmax probabilities) deterministically
        becomes the next note it will observe. If True, the next observation
        will be sampled from the model's softmax output.
      algorithm: can be 'default', 'psi', 'g' or 'pure_rl', for different
        learning algorithms
      note_rnn_checkpoint_dir: The directory from which the internal
        NoteRNNLoader will load its checkpointed LSTM.
      note_rnn_checkpoint_file: A checkpoint file to use in case one cannot be
        found in the note_rnn_checkpoint_dir.
      note_rnn_type: If 'default', will use the basic LSTM described in the
        research paper. If 'basic_rnn', will assume the checkpoint is from a
        Magenta basic_rnn model.
      note_rnn_hparams: A HParams object which defines the hyper parameters
        used to train the MelodyRNN model that will be loaded from a checkpoint.
      num_notes_in_melody: The length of a composition of the model
      input_size: the size of the one-hot vector encoding a note that is input
        to the model.
      num_actions: The size of the one-hot vector encoding a note that is
        output by the model.
      midi_primer: A midi file that can be used to prime the model if
        priming_mode is set to 'single_midi'.
      save_name: Name the model will use to save checkpoints.
      output_every_nth: How many training steps before the model will print
        an output saying the cumulative reward, and save a checkpoint.
      training_file_list: A list of paths to tfrecord files containing melody
        training data. This is necessary to use the 'random_midi' priming mode.
      summary_writer: A tf.summary.FileWriter used to log metrics.
      initialize_immediately: if True, the class will instantiate its component
        MelodyRNN networks and build the graph in the constructor.
