    <p>Magenta is a Google Brain project to ask and answer
the questions, “Can we use machine learning to create compelling art
and music? If so, how? If not, why not?”  Our work will be done in
<a href="https://www.tensorflow.org">TensorFlow</a>, and we’ll release our models and tools in open
source. These will be accompanied by demos, tutorial
blog postings and technical papers.  To follow our progress,
watch our <a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/magenta">GitHub</a>
and or join our <a href="https://groups.google.com/a/tensorflow.org/forum/#!forum/magenta-discuss">discussion group</a>.</p>

<p>Magenta encompasses two goals. It’s first a research project to
advance the state-of-the art in music, video, image and text
generation. So much has been done with machine learning to understand
content— for example speech recognition and translation; in this
project we want to explore content generation and creativity.  Second,
Magenta is an attempt to build a community of artists, coders and
machine learning researchers. To facilitate that, the core Magenta
team will build open-source infrastructure around TensorFlow for
making art and music.  This will start with audio and video support in
TensorFlow, tools for working with data formats like MIDI, and
platforms that help artists connect to machine learning models.  For
example, one of our goals is to make it super simple to play music
along with a Magenta performance model.</p>

<h2 id="credits">Credits</h2>
<p>Like TensorFlow, Magenta was originally developed by researchers and
engineers working on the Google Brain Team within Google’s Machine
Intelligence research organization. Magenta is not complete; it is
intended to be built upon, improved, and extended.  We hope to build
an active open source community that drives development in music and
art generation using machine learning, both by providing feedback and
by actively contributing to the source code.</p>

<p>The following people have contributed code or organizational effort to Magenta: 
Adam Roberts,
Christine Robson,
Cinjon Resnick,
Dan Abolafia,
David So,
Douglas Eck,
Elliot Waite,
Fred Bertsch,
Greg Corrado,
Joshua Metherd and
Max Strakhov.</p>
